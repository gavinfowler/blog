I am currently a senior studying computer science at Utah State University. Some of my favorite classes have been Mobile Application Development, Operating Systems and concurrency, and Introduction to Landscape Architecture.

During the school year I worked on the following projects:

* [Restaurant Picker](https://github.com/gavinfowler/RestaurantPicker)
* [A workout app](https://github.com/gavinfowler/CS3200FinalProject)

I am currently working on at the Space Dynamics Lab in Logan, UT as an engineering assistant. I am working on a Java web application with Extjs on the frontend.

I have played many instruments but I most enjoyed playing saxophone and Euphonium.

I played in a jazz band all through middle school and high school. I am a fan of jaz music with some of my favorite artists being: the Brecker Brothers, Tower of Power, and Charlie Parker.

I participated in marching band for 3 years in highschool and this led to a year in the Battalion Drum and Bugle Corps (pronounced 'core' ;) ).
