[RestaurantPicker](https://github.com/gavinfowler/RestaurantPicker) is an app to help people in groups decide where to eat.

This app was developed for MIS 5700 at USU. The project was to create any sort of web-based service that could grow into a business. Most groups chose an Amazon-style website where things could be sold from either their company, who would make the products or the community, in a kind of Uber-style application. My team decided to do something different, create an application that would help groups of friends decide where to eat. We thought about doing a web application than decided that if people were going to use this idea we needed to have a more mainstream way to use it. This leads us to decide to develop an app.

We used React-Native to develop this app because two of us were already in a mobile application development class and we already knew React-Native. Within React-Native we used NativeBase as an additional package because NativeBase provides many good looking components that fit our needs.

In order to get the restaurants that were near the users, we decided to use the Yelp API. The documentation was pretty straight forward but we were not doing incredibly intense querying. That being said, I would not hesitate to use them again if I was in a position where I needed data like that again.

There are still some improvements that could be made to this app. Currently, there is no way for this app to make money. One plan that we did have for this app, but did not have the time for was to have ads. We have space at the bottom (this can be seen on the README on GitHub) ready for ads but we have not added the functionality quite yet.
