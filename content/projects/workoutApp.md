For the final project in my Mobile Development class, we were asked to create an app that would be able to track your exercise, specifically your runs.

While coding this app I learned about many different packages and android APIs. Some of the packages I used were

* NativeBase
* React-Native Camera
* React-Native Maps
* React Navigation

Through this was one of the hardest assignments in that class, I learned quite a bit. Figuring out how to make sure to use the packages together properly was one of the most frustrating parts. Just attempting to run anything once I had installed the packages was difficult. The solution to my problem was to shift my react-native version back.

All the frustrating parts aside, I did have a lot of fun putting this app together. Being able to create a line of dots on a map from GPS information was a satisfying moment. Once I got everything wired up and working like I wanted it was an incredible feeling. Being able to take such an abstract idea and turn it into reality is such a great feeling. That feeling is one of the main reasons I decided to become a programmer.

Although I would have liked to add persistent data, it was not one of the requirements and unfortunately I had many other finals to worry about ðŸ˜‰. Persistent data was one of the few things from that class that I felt like I never understood all that well. But I am currently building an app right now that requires persistent data so I'll have to figure it out soon.
