  All the information I got for this article was obtained from the Elasticsearch documentation. This will be a basic overview of building a query, using nested models, and aggregations.
I recently wrote a post about all the work I did to speed up searching, and I wanted to go a little bit more in depth as to what I learned. Some of the stuff that I was doing was pretty trivial, but others like aggregation, was not.

  Recently I was able to work on the Elasticsearch integration on the project I am currently on at work. The application is a catalog of small satellite parts. It is a site where people who are building these small satellites can come explore the many different companies who are manufacturing these parts. It is a very interesting project to work on, sometimes it can be quite frustrating as well as rewarding.

For the final project in my Mobile Development class, we were asked to create an app that would be able to track your exercise, specifically your runs.
While coding this app I learned about many different packages and android APIs. Some of the packages I used were
 NativeBase React-Native Camera React-Native Maps React Navigation  Through this was one of the hardest assignments in that class, I learned quite a bit.

  RestaurantPicker is an app to help people in groups decide where to eat.
This app was developed for MIS 5700 at USU. The project was to create any sort of web-based service that could grow into a business. Most groups chose an Amazon-style website where things could be sold from either their company, who would make the products or the community, in a kind of Uber-style application. My team decided to do something different, create an application that would help groups of friends decide where to eat.

  Link to LaTeX to HTML
One of the projects I recently undertook was a chrome extension that would accept LaTeX as input and output HTML code that would render the LaTeX in a nice format.
At my job at the Space Dynamics Lab, I was able to do something similar. We had some units that we wanted to render in a pretty format, for example, if we had &lsquo;sec/m^2&rsquo; we could render it as:
